## ⭐️ Why I Built This

As a technical product manager, I believe in building systems that are both **intelligent** and **transparent**.
This project solves a real business problem:
**How do you make personalized recommendations explainable, testable, and user-centric in real time?**

* **Bridges ML, product analytics, and UX**
* Inspired by product management interviews and real-world use cases at Microsoft, Google, etc.
* Shows how LLMs and cloud-native analytics can deliver explainable, A/B-tested recommendations at scale.

## 🧩 Features

* **Personalized Movie Recommendations** via API (FastAPI)
* **A/B Testing of ML Models** (easily compare v1 vs v2 in production)
* **LLM-Powered Onboarding** (converts free-text user interests into actionable user profiles)
* **Real-Time Feedback Logging** (users can ‘like’ or ‘dislike’ recommendations, improving system over time)
* **Fully Transparent Analytics Dashboard** (Streamlit, with live charts and usage stats)
* **Production-Ready Deployment** (Streamlit Cloud for dashboard, Render.com for API)
* **API Docs Autogenerated** (testable via Swagger UI)
